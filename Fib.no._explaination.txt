Fibonacci series  has been a very interesting series whatsoever , which means the next term will be the sum of present term and the previous term , starting with t0=0;

A great observation is that as every element of a fibonacci series is sum of some terms , any integer can be expressed as a sum of some minimum fibonacci terms .

Is it not a good idea to solve that sequence . as you have two hours of time for the test,why not spend 25-30 minutes for this algorithm ?? 

Given any integer as a input , represent that integer as a sum of fibonacci series.

 

INPUT

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.

each test-case is described with one integer N, the integer you want to represent as a sum of fibonacci terms.

 

OUTPUT

For each test case, output a single line containing all the terms/answer to the test-case separated by a space.

 

CONSTRAINTS

0<T<100

1<=N<=10000

SAMPLE INPUT 		SAMPLE OUTPUT 
2			        7 1
14			        5
5

Explanation:
enter the number that you want represent as a sum of fibonacci series:  14
 can be expressed as f[7]=13  f[1]=1 , where f[N] implies fibonacci term N .
